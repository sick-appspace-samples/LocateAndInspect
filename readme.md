## LocateAndInspect
Matching objects and inspecting image details.
### Description
Teaching the shape of "golden" parts and matching identical objects with full
rotation in the full image. Also inspecting a detail (letter count) on the part
to verify its correctness.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
in AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used..
